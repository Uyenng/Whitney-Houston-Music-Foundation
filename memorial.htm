            <p>Houston reportedly appeared "disheveled" and "erratic" in the days immediately prior to her death. 
                On February 9, 2012, Houston visited singers Brandy and Monica, together with Clive Davis, 
                at their rehearsals for Davis' pre-Grammy Awards party at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills. 
                That same day, she made her last public performance when she joined Kelly Price on stage in Hollywood, 
<img id="la" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c1/Los_Angeles_County_Coroner_Department_seal.png">
                California and sang "Jesus Loves Me".
            </p><p>
                Two days later, on February 11, Houston was found unconscious in Suite 434 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, 
                submerged in the bathtub. Beverly Hills paramedics arrived at approximately 3:30 p.m., 
                found Houston unresponsive, and performed CPR. Houston was pronounced dead at 3:55 p.m. PST. 
                The cause of death was not immediately known; local police said there were "no obvious signs of 
                criminal intent". On March 22, 2012, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County_Department_of_Medical_Examiner-Coroner" target="_blank">
                Los Angeles County Coroner's Office</a>
                reported that Houston's death was caused by drowning and the "effects of atherosclerotic heart disease and cocaine use". 
                The office stated the amount of cocaine found in Houston's body indicated that she used the substance 
                shortly before her death. Toxicology results revealed additional drugs in her system: 
                diphenhydramine (Benadryl), alprazolam (Xanax), cannabis and cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril). 
                The manner of death was listed as an "accident".

                An invitation-only memorial service was held for Houston on Saturday, February 18, 2012, at the New Hope 
                Baptist Church in Newark, New Jersey. <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4618540/Bobbi-Kristina-s-tombstone-seen-time.html" target="_blank">
                <img width ="300" style="float: right;margin:12px" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d4/41/55/d44155feb295cf9767da32873b2021da.jpg"></a>
                The service was scheduled for two hours, but lasted four. 
                Among those who performed at the funeral were Stevie Wonder (rewritten version of "Ribbon in the Sky", 
                and "Love's in Need of Love Today"), CeCe Winans ("Don't Cry", and "Jesus Loves Me"), Alicia Keys 
                ("Send Me an Angel"), Kim Burrell (rewritten version of "A Change Is Gonna Come"), and R. Kelly 
                ("I Look to You"). The performances were interspersed with hymns by the church choir and remarks by 
                Clive Davis, Houston's record producer; Kevin Costner; Rickey Minor, her music director; her cousin, 
                Dionne Warwick; and Ray Watson, her security guard for the past 11 years. 
                Aretha Franklin was listed on the program and was expected to sing, but was unable to attend the service. Bobby Brown 
                was also invited to the funeral, but departed shortly after the service began. 
                Houston was buried on February 19, 2012, in Fairview Cemetery, in Westfield, New Jersey, next to 
                her father, John Russell Houston, who died in 2003. In June 2012, the McDonald's Gospelfest 
                in Newark became a tribute to Houston.
            
            </p><p>Singer Whitney Houston's family has decided against a public memorial for her at a New Jersey sports arena, 
                and will hold an invitation-only service at the church where she first sang publicly, and where her 
                mother, singer Cissy Houston, still attends services... <a href="https://www.today.com/news/no-public-memorial-whitney-houston-1C9379700">
