            <p>Whitney Elizabeth Houston was born on <b>August 9, 1963</b>, 
            in a middle-income neighborhood in Newark, 
            <img id="fam" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/57/25/3a/57253a08e6a9cbd49dcd8c33ab2336f8.jpg">
            New Jersey. She was the daughter of Army serviceman and 
            entertainment executive John Russell Houston, Jr. and gospel 
            singer Emily "Cissy" (Drinkard) Houston. Her elder brother 
            Michael is a singer, and her elder half-brother is former 
            basketball player Gary Garland. Her parents were both 
            African-American. Through her mother, Houston was a first 
            cousin of singers Dionne Warwick and Dee Dee Warwick. 
            Her godmother was Darlene Love and her honorary aunt was 
            Aretha Franklin, whom she met at <b>age 8 or 9</b> when her mother 
            took her to a recording studio. Houston was raised a Baptist, 
            but was also exposed to the Pentecostal church. 
            After the <b>1967 Newark riots</b>, the family moved to a middle-class 
            area in East Orange, New Jersey, when she was <b>four</b>. 
            Her parents later divorced.</P>
            <div id="intro">Teenage</div>
            <p>At <b>age 11</b>, Houston started performing as a <span style="color:red;font-weight: bold;">
            soloist</span> in the junior gospel choir at the New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, 
            where she also learned to play the piano. Her first solo 
            performance in the church was "Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah".</p>
                
            <p>While Houston was still in school, her mother, Cissy, 
            continued to teach her how to sing. Cissy was a member of the 
            group The Sweet Inspirations 
            <img id ="sweet" src="https://images.45cat.com/the-sweet-inspirations-sweet-inspiration-atlantic-9-s.jpg">
            which also opened for and sang 
            backup for Elvis Presley. Houston spent some of her teenage 
            years touring nightclubs where Cissy was performing, and she 
            would occasionally get on stage and perform with her. Houston 
            was also exposed to the music of Chaka Khan, Gladys Knight, 
            and Roberta Flack, most of whom would have an influence on 
            her as a singer and performer. <b>In 1977</b>, at <b>age 14</b>, she became 
            a <span style="color:red;font-weight: bold;">backup singer</span> on the Michael Zager Band's 
            single "Life's a Party". <b>In 1978</b>, at <b>age 15</b>, Houston sang background vocals for Chaka 
            Khan and Lou Rawls. Houston attended Mount Saint Dominic Academy, 
            a Catholic girls' high school in Caldwell, New Jersey; 
            she graduated from Mount Saint Dominic in <b>1981</b>. During her 
            teen years, Houston met Robyn Crawford, who she described as the 
            "sister she never had". Crawford went on to become Houston's 
            best friend, roommate, and executive assistant. After Houston 
            rose to stardom, she and Crawford were rumored to be lovers, 
            which they both denied in <b>1987</b>. In <b>2019</b>, several years after 
            Houston's death, Crawford stated that their early relationship 
            had included sexual activity, but that Houston ended this for 
            fear of others' reactions.</p>

                <div id="intro">1980s</div>
                <p>In the early <b>1980s</b>, Houston started working as a <span style="color:red;font-weight: bold;">fashion model</span> 
            after a photographer saw her at Carnegie Hall singing with her 
            mother. She became the first woman of color to appear on the cover 
            of Seventeen and appeared in Glamour, Cosmopolitan and Young Miss, 
            and appeared in a Canada Dry soft drink TV commercial. 
            Her looks and girl-next-door charm made her one of the most 
            sought-after teen models. In <b>1982</b>, under the suggestion of 
            longtime friend Valerie Simpson, Houston signed with Tara 
            Productions and hired Daniel Gittleman, Seymour Flics and 
            Gene Harvey as her managers. With Gittleman, Flics and Harvey, 
            Houston continued her burgeoning recording career by working 
            with producers Michael Beinhorn, Bill Laswell and Martin Bisi 
            on an album they were spearheading called One Down, which was 
            credited to the group Material. For that project, 
            Houston contributed the ballad "Memories", a cover of a song by 
            Hugh Hopper of Soft Machine. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice 
            called her contribution "one of the most gorgeous ballads 
            you've ever heard". She also appeared as a <span style="color:red;font-weight: bold;">lead vocalist </span>
            on one track on a Paul Jabara album, entitled Paul Jabara and 
            Friends, released by Columbia Records in <b>1983</b>.</p>
                
            <p><b>In 1983</b>, Gerry Griffith, an A&R representative from Arista Records, 
            saw Houston performing with her mother in a New York City 
            nightclub. He convinced Arista's head Clive Davis to make 
            time to see Houston perform. Davis was impressed and immediately 
            offered a worldwide recording contract, which Houston signed. 
            (Houston had been offered deals by recording agencies before-by 
            Michael Zager in <b>1980</b>, and by Elektra Records in <b>1981</b>-but her 
            mother declined them on the grounds that Whitney had yet to 
            complete high school.) Later that year, Houston made her <span style="color:red;font-weight: bold;">national 
            television debut</span> alongside Davis on The Merv Griffin Show. 
            She performed "Home", a song from the musical The Wiz.</p>
                
            <p>Houston did not begin work on an album immediately. 
            The label wanted to make sure no other label signed her away, 
            and Davis wanted to ensure he had the right material and 
            producers for Houston's debut album. Some producers had to 
            pass on the project because of prior commitments. Houston first 
            recorded a duet with Teddy Pendergrass, "Hold Me", which appeared 
            on his gold album, Love Language. The single was released 
            in <b>1984</b> and gave Houston her first taste of success, becoming a 
            Top 5 R&B hit. It would also appear on her debut album in <b>1985</b>.
