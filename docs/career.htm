            <p>Whitney Houston began singing in church as a child. While still in high school, 
                <img id="young"src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/9b/d2/3d/9bd23d780e415d479c36fc2cb8816b3a.jpg">
                she sang backup for Chaka Khan and Lou Rawls and modeled for fashion magazines. 
                At <b>age 19</b> she signed with Arista Records, whose president, Clive Davis, groomed the 
                gospel-based singer for crossover pop success. Her debut album, Whitney Houston (<b>1985</b>), 
                yielded three number one singles in the United States: "Greatest Love of All," which 
                became her signature; "Saving All My Love for You"; and "How Will I Know." Whitney (<b>1987</b>) 
                delivered four more number ones and earned Houston a Grammy Award (for the single 
                "I Wanna Dance with Somebody"). <b>In 1992</b> she married singer Bobby Brown and made her 
                motion-picture debut in The Bodyguard; the film featured her rendition of Dolly 
                Parton's "I Will Always Love You," which stayed at number one for 14 weeks. 
                The film's sound track dominated the Grammys the following year, with Houston winning 
                the awards for album of the year, record of the year, and best female pop vocal performance. 
                In the <b>mid-1990s</b> she continued acting, in films such as Waiting to Exhale (<b>1995</b>) 
                and The Preacher's Wife (<b>1996</b>), and the sound track of each film generated hit singles for her.
            </p><p>
            <b>In 1998</b> Houston released My Love Is Your Love, which did not sell as well as 
            previous efforts but was praised by the critics and earned her another Grammy Award. 
        <b>In 2001</b> she signed a new multialbum contract with Arista for $100 million, but personal 
        difficulties soon overshadowed her recording career. Houston's tumultuous relationship with 
        Brown (the couple divorced in <b>2007</b>) provided fodder for the tabloids, as did her acknowledged 
        drug use and financial issues. <img id="sing"src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/waen3fm50Gk/hqdefault.jpg">
        Her <b>2002</b> album, Just Whitney, was a personal response 
        to her detractors, but its sales were disappointing compared with earlier efforts. 
        Other than a lacklustre holiday album, One Wish (<b>2003</b>), Houston spent subsequent years 
        in a state of virtual retirement.
            </p><p>
                In February <b>2009</b> she began a comeback effort with a four-song set at Clive Davis's 
                annual pre-Grammy Awards gala. The performance was greeted warmly, and in June Houston 
                announced that an album of new material would be available later that year. 
                I Look to You was released in August to positive reviews, and standout songs included 
                the up-tempo "Million Dollar Bill" (penned by Alicia Keys) and the title track, a 
                slow-building ballad written by R. Kelly. In February <b>2012</b> Houston died in a 
                bathtub at a Beverly Hills hotel shortly before Davis's pre-Grammy party.
